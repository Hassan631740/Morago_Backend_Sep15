## 🚀 Quick Start - Deploy in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Generate Secrets
```bash
./generate-railway-secrets.sh
```
This will create a file with all your secure secrets. **Keep it safe!**

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Create Railway Project
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Choose `morago-backend-sep15`

### Step 4: Add MySQL Database
1. In Railway project, click **"New"**
2. Select **"Database"** → **"Add MySQL"**
3. Wait for provisioning (takes ~30 seconds)

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables
1. Click on your service (morago-backend)
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Copy the variables from the generated secrets file
4. Click **"Add Variable"** for each one

**Required Variables:**
```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://${{MYSQLHOST}}:${{MYSQLPORT}}/${{MYSQLDATABASE}}?useSSL=true&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&serverTimezone=UTC
DB_USERNAME=${{MYSQLUSER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MYSQLPASSWORD}}
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000
JWT_EXPIRATION_MS=3600000
SECURITY_JWT_SECRET=<from-generated-file>
SOCKETIO_HOST=0.0.0.0
SOCKETIO_PORT=9092
SOCKETIO_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.com
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10MB
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=10MB
```

### Step 6: Deploy
Railway will automatically start deploying. Monitor progress in the **"Deployments"** tab.

### Step 7: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, test your endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/actuator/health

# Expected response: {"status":"UP"}
```

```bash
# Swagger UI
https://your-app.up.railway.app/swagger-ui.html
```

## 🔍 Health Check Endpoints

Your application now includes these monitoring endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `/actuator/health` | Application health status | No |
| `/actuator/info` | Application information | No |
| `/actuator/metrics` | Application metrics | Yes (Admin) |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
```bash
# Check Java version
java -version  # Should be 21+

# Rebuild locally
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### Deployment Fails?
1. Check Railway logs: **Deployments → Latest → View Logs**
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure MySQL database is running
4. Check `DB_URL` format

### Health Check Fails?
```bash
# Test locally first
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=prod

# Check actuator endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Can't Connect to Database?
1. Verify Railway MySQL is running
2. Check variables: `MYSQLHOST`, `MYSQLPORT`, etc.
3. Ensure `DB_URL` uses reference variables: `${{MYSQLHOST}}`
